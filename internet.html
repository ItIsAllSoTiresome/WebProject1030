        Internet Information
      </h1>
      <p>
          The Internet has a complex structure. It its simplest form, it is just a network of computers.
        What is important is that there is a transmission of information between these computers. Since computers only 
        understand the machine code(0s and 1s), it is important to convert the information that is understandable to humans
        to the one that is understandable by computers via the process of encoding. Furthermore, since many technological devices
        have found a continuously deeper integration within our everyday lives, a lot of sensitive information is transmitted through
        the Internet. As such, it becomes paramount to secure the communication channels that transmit the sensitive information along with 
        the information itself. Such is done via the process called encryption. Below you will find more detailed information about
        the Internet, encoding, and encryption

      <div class="container">
        <h4 class = "fw-bold text-success">The Internet: Components</h4>    
        <p>There are three fundamental components of the Internet: 
          networks, protocols, and physical connections</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Networks</dt>
          <dd>- A computer network is a connection between two or more computers.
           Such connection is done so that there is sharing of resources, information, 
           and even services. Networks enable wide-scale communication and collaboration
          </dd>
          <dt>Physical Connections</dt>
            <p>
              Below are the methods by which the information is transferred over a network.
              Remember, the information must be transferred as a series of 0s and 1s
            </p>
            <dd> <mark>Wires</mark> - These are physical wires that are used to transfer information within a network.
                          It uses electrical current to send 0s and 1s between connected machines
            </dd>
            <dd><mark>Fiber Optics</mark> - Technology that utilizes glass or plastic fibers to transmit information(0s and 1s).
                                            The technology uses light pulses to transmit the information. The core of the fiber is
                                            made from silica(pure glass), and these cores are coated with plastic
            </dd>
            <dd><mark>Wi-Fi</mark> - a wireless networking technology that utilizes radio waves to transmit information(0s and 1s).
                                    More specifically, the waves are between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and are a form of electromagnetic radiation
            </dd>
          <dt>Protocols</dt>
            <p>
              Protocols are agreed upon procedures or set of rules that govern certain actions.
              There are two fundamental protocols that form the Internet, TCP/IP. These protocols
              are the backbone that define HOW communication on a network occurs
            </p> 
            <dd> <mark>IP Protocol</mark> - The Internet Protocol(IP) is a set of rules governing the formatting and transmission of data across 
                                              the network It is resposnible for several functions:
          <dd>-It divides the data(information) into small packets. This process is called <a class href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/" target="_blank">packet switching</a>
          </dd>
                <dd>-It contains addressing capability that assigns a unique identifier(IP address) 
                     to each machine on a network. This allows for the correct data packets to arrive at its own unique address. As such, IP protocol 
                     is also resposnsible for the path that data packets take to grom from the sender, to routers, and, finally, to the sender.
                     This process is called <a class href = "https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/" target="_blank">routing.</a> 
                     This is one half of the reliability equation in network communication. 
                </dd>
            </dd>
            <dd><mark>TCP Protocol</mark> - Transmission Control Protocol is a procedure that controls communication between
                                             machines on a network. The difference between IP and TCP is that IP formats the data itself;
                                             TCP ensures, and establishes, a reliable connection between communicating machines on a network and assures that 
                                             the right packets arrive at their destination by checking to make sure that all network packets arrived for any pice of transmitted data.
                                             Usually the network packets containing data do not take the direct path to the receiver.
                                             The packets go to different routers until reaching the receiver. Such is because some routers mihgt be overloaded and 
                                             won't be able to reroute data packets. An appropriate metaphor for inactive routers would be a traffic congestion in real life(except of course data packets can take a different path - unlike the driver stuck in the traffic)

        <dt>Encoding</dt>
          <p> Encoding is the process of converting information from one format into another.
              In this section the information like a decimal number is converted to ASCII and then to binary. Below is a detailed explanation for all 3 of those
          </p>
          <dd><mark>Decimal</mark> - Decimal numbering system refers to the system of numbers from 0-9. The numbers carry the weight of base 10 depending on a position.
                                     As such, the number 123 can be broken down to its individual components. The rightmost number, 3 in this case, represents position 0.
                                     The weight of the position is 3 * 10^0 = 3. The 2 represents position 1 and its weight is represented by 2*10^1 = 20(the carrot represents an exponent).
                                     The 1 represents position 2 and its weight is represented by 1*10^2 = 100. Adding all three numbers we get 3+20+100= 123
          
          </dd>
          <dd><mark>Binary</mark> - Binary numbering system only uses 0 and 1 to express information. Just like the binary system, there is weight associated with position. Unlike the binary system,
                                    the weight of each numbers is base 2. As such, binary number 0111 can be broken down to its individual components. The rightmost 1 represents position 0.
                                    The weight of the position is 1 * 2^0 = 1. Going one space over to the left, the 1 on that position represents position 1. The weight of the position is 1 * 2^1 = 2. 
                                    Going one space over to the left, the 1 on that position represents position 2. The weight of the position is 1 * 2^2 = 4. Finally, going left one last time, represent position 3.
                                    A 0 on that position carries the weight of 0 * 2^3 = 0. Adding all the numbers together converts the binary number to a decimal 1 + 2 + 4 + 0(usually discarded) = 7(in decimal). 
                                    A single binary position is called a bit, so number 0111 is said to be represented by 4 bits
                                    
          
          </dd>
           <dd><mark>ASCII</mark> - American Standard Code for Information Interchange, in its original form, used 7-bit binary numbers to represent different numbers, letters, and symbols common in the English language.
                                    Modern version of ASCII, called extended ASCII, utilize 1 byte, or 8 bits. 
                                  
          </dd>

          <dt>Encryption</dt>
          <p> Encryption is the process of turning the plain text(data) into cypher text. The purpose behind it is that
              only individuals who are granted the privelege of decrpytion(turning cypher text into plain text) are granted access to the data. The cypher text is unreadable
              and serves no purpose other than to be decrypted. There are two methods of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. They are explained in detail below
          </p>
            <dd><mark>Symmetric encryption</mark> - uses the same key for encryption and decrpytion. Presents security risks, but it is still used today. Specifically,
                                                    it is used by banks for encrypting banking transactions and by large data storage organizations. Once again, though risky, it is faster than asymmetric encryption
            </dd>
            <dd><mark>Asymmetric encryption</mark> - uses two different keys for encryption and decrpytion. Usually the pair of keys is called a public and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt.
                                                    Today, it is the most common method of securing over the network communication, or more specifically, client-server interaction.

          <dt>HTTPS and Security</dt>
            <dd>-HTTPS uses TLS, or Transport Secure Layer, to establish a secure communication channel between the client
                 and the server. TLS requires a key exchange between these two entities called the handshake. This means
                 only the person receiving information can decrypt and only individual sending the information can encrypt it
            </dd>
